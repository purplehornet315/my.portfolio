            <p>
                First, thank you for taking the time to look at this portfolio.<br/>
                I have been working hard to put these works and projects in front of you to review.<br/>
                I currently am working as a production supervisor of our company's printing department<br/>
                With this i have learned how much team work equals success.<br/>
                I have also had the opportunity to lead successful projects and comfortable in a leadership role.<br/>
                My leadership style is heavily based off of "The Leadership Challenge" by Kouzes and Posner.<br/>
                I have a Bachelors Degree and a Certificate in Leadership Theory from Middle Tennessee State University.<br/>
                I am happily married to my wife Taylor. We have our hands full with our three beautiful daughters.<br/>
                As you can see from the picture.
